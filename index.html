            <p style="color:#57744B">Welcome to our farm shop website, where you can find all the information that you need about our products and services.
            The farm shop has a wide range of fresh products, from jams and preserves to eggs and bacon.
            We have free-range eggs that are laid by the chickens on our farm.
            Our pork is reared in the fields around our house, giving it a distinctive flavour. Choose from award winning pies with fillings such as: apricot or blackberry; hand-made chocolates; local honey and marmalade; homemade breads and cakes; locally sourced fruit juices, wines, beers and ciders. We also sell fresh vegetables grown in our garden!</p>
            <p style="color:#57744B">We are also delighted to provide you with a truly unique, fun, and fascinating show grown from the love of animals, and reactions of children and adults from every walk of life. Come enjoy our petting zoo and experience close encounters with our animals. Give your children a unforgettable memory.</p>
